Note: 
1) To fast the process of learning, I reduced the iteration of SGD to total 50 iterations. You could increase it in order to get a better performance.
2) For hamming distance kernel, please please comment out line 75 and uncomment line 77 in file script_classify.py

3) You could check individual algorithm by commenting/uncommenting algorithms between line 48-55 in script_classify.py
